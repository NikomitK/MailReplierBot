# MailReplierBot

In times of online classes, our maths teacher used to send us emails where we had to reply that
we actually opened them, so I coded a program that checks your mail inbox every few minutes and replies
with a text that you can choose yourself. You can also choose the email adress of the person you want to 
reply to and a string that has to be in the email to trigger your reply.
Not entirely finished but had to pause this because of more important stuff for school :(
